# üíª Windows Ransomware Detection Lab  

## üîπ Overview  
Ransomware attacks are one of the most dangerous threats faced by organizations. This project simulates **Windows Event Logs (Sysmon + Security logs)** that include both normal activity and ransomware-like behavior.  

The lab demonstrates how to:  
- Detect **file encryption activity**  
- Identify **suspicious process execution** (PowerShell, cmd, wmic abuse)  
- Spot **persistence techniques** used by ransomware  
- Map detections to **MITRE ATT&CK**

## üîπ Dataset  
Dataset: `datasets/windows_event_logs.csv`  

The log entries include:  
- **Normal Events**  
  - User logon/logoff (Event ID 4624, 4634)  
  - File read/write operations  
  - Normal PowerShell usage  

- **Suspicious/Malicious Events**  
  - Multiple file modifications in short time (encryption behavior)  
  - Process execution: `vssadmin delete shadows`, `cipher.exe`  
  - Persistence via `Run` registry key modification  
  - Network connection to suspicious IPs for C2

## üîπ Detection Logic  

### üìå SPL (Splunk Queries)  

**1. Detect mass file encryption activity**  
```spl
index=win_event_logs
| search EventID=11 OR EventID=4663
| stats count by process_name, target_file
| where count > 100
```

**2. Detect shadow copy deletion (common ransomware behavior)**  
```spl
index=win_event_logs
| search EventID=1 process_name="vssadmin.exe" CommandLine="*delete shadows*"
| table _time, user, process_name, CommandLine
```

**3. Detect persistence in registry keys**  
```spl
index=win_event_logs
| search EventID=13 registry_key_path="*\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run*"
| table _time, user, process_name, registry_key_path
```

## üîπ Sigma Rules  

### üõ°Ô∏è Ransomware ‚Äì Shadow Copy Deletion  
```yaml

  category: process_creation
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: "vssadmin.exe"
    CommandLine|contains: "delete shadows"
  condition: selection

  - User
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate system maintenance
level: critical
```
